# CLTs

This repo is a practice repo for building the intuition and skills to train Cross-Layer Transcoders (CLTs) from scratch.

CLTs were developed to deal with some of the limitations of Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs), mainly:

- cross-layer superposition
- circuit complexity

## Implementation Steps
